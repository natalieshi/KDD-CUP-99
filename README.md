Problem: Intrusion Detector Learning 
  1.Four catogories: DOS,R2L,U2R,Probing
  2.Derived Feature: 
    Basic Feature: 
    Content Feature:
    Traffic Feature:
    
  Train data: forty-one feature(discrete,continues)
              target: normal,neptune
              
  Step1: use small set data to decide which machine learning algorithm is best.
         1. SVM
         2. Weka(ask them for toturial)
         Method1: Use R package(from the book)
         Method2: Use Java
